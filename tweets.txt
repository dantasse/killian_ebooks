I am, officially, all kinds of legal.
I apologize for spelling "buoy" incorrectly. I know that probably offended a lot of seafaring folk who expect better from me.
I ate some gross soup for lunch and now I'm experiencing debilitating nostalgia. #interesting
I ate too much llajua.
I beat the lunch rush at Jude the Obscure by literally one minute. This place is hoppin'. Wowzies. (I'm editing and drinking.) #fun
I believe Emerson Cod is outside my window! #ohHELLno
I can hear Daniel and Matthew watching Gravity Falls downstairs. Rude. #homeworkruinseverything
I can only take so much rejection, guys. I'm a delicate flower.
I can tell I'm getting sick because I'm wearing glasses and in bed. My body aches spectacularly, too, so that's also a nice hint.
I can't decide if I'm actually stuck, or if I'm being a wimp. Is it always better to push through? I guess the answer is yes?
I can't lie to you guys. I really like "The New Girl". Judge all you want. Doesn't matter. I will love Zooey D forevah. #incurablegirlcrush
I could really do without this traditional week in which Portland tries to be like Phoenix.
I did write a pretty good blarg post tonight, though.  http://t.co/Avm9lvCe
I discourage all of you from getting foot tattoos. They actually hurt.
I do love a good sunrise.
I don't know how to deal with emotions that aren't loud.
I don't like being "fooled" by things that are "pretending" to be "prose fiction" but are actually "poems". EFF THAT i like good stuff
I don't think the world knows just how huge my crush on Kristin Chenoweth is. It's about as huge as her assets. So, enormous.
I don't want to work. I want to read friggin' Pilgrim! Whine.
I encouraged that V2 to be my classy lady tonight! #bouldering #politePWNing
I feel a variety of Not Great. Tummy ache, head ache, grumpalumpagus.
I feel floofy!
I feel like Arnold from the Magic Schoolbus. Only, my day is less adventurey and more full of awkward meetings.
I feel like a cow enjoying grass on a frosty winter morn. It tastes very...cold. and green.
I feel like this: http://tinyurl.com/4fcjhtc
I fell asleep with my head propped up on the fold-out tray table at my seat, and I dreamed about snow.
I find the Earl of Lemongrab to be equal parts hilarious and utterly terrifying
I finished my hooooomework so now I'm gonna read cooooomics. #awyeah
I get back, and find they're remodeling/rearranging my grocery store. TOO MUCH CHANGE AT ONCE. CAN'T. HANDLE IT.
I get piles of homework done, but it is never enough. Quandry: do more, or drink some tea?
I got Daniel sunflowers today. They are super duper purdy.
I got a pickle, I got a pickle, I got a pickle, hey hey hey hey! *pickle dance*
I got an email back last night from beatonna and I did a drunken happy dance. It was just as awesome when I read it this morning, soberly
I guess I should give a few more stories a go but thusfar PSU prof Dan DeWeese is the saving grace of PDX Noir. Disappointment is mounting.
I guess it's good I got a job, because I just had to buy some glasses. My right eye is so bad, dfwaffles is calling me Odin.
I had black pudding for the first time this afternoon. And you know what? I liked it.
I have Mario's "Just a Friend" stuck in my head. It's one of the better songs I've had stuck there this week. Thanks, 2002.
I have a headache, so I'mma go to the Sextant with my bros and drink weird hot toddies. T'is my favorite weekly activity.
I have a lot of things that are not easily categorized in my packing process. Which box does ceramic smoking baby belong in??
I have a pink wig, and my life has meaning. Coincidence? I think not.
I have a sailor hat, and you do not. Point.
I have a spiritual relationship with "The Rainbow Connection". It's a profoundly existential song, guys. It gives me feelings.
I have a sunburn that appeared out of nowhere. Et tu, SPF 45? I applied you every twenty minutes.
I have no idea what day of the week it is or, quite frankly, what time even means anymore, besides: run to the next thing. #RESIDENCYWATCH
I have read so many words today that no sentences sound real anymore. Like when you say "spoon" or "watermelon" too many times. freak wordz
I have some amazing friends, checkin' in on me and makin sure I'm ok. They's the best. :'}
I have to get some new novel pages done or my writing group will force me to write goldfish erotica. I wish I was joking.
I have to resort to self-bribery in order to finish all the projects. I can't afford a tattoo, so: every episode of Breaking Bad, it is.
I hope people can tell I'm a perennial scholar by the fact that I can't do things like: even imagine how to use a barbecue.
I just accidentally ate moldy cheese. And not the kind that's supposed to be moldy. My body hates me so much right now.
I just ate 80 clams at Pirates Cove--or, as my dad has taken to calling it, The Pirate's Blow Hole.
I just finished the first draft of the best short story I have ever written. I might be a *liiiiittle* bit excited.
I just had this adventure where I was writing on the porch and my brother, who knew I was there, locked me out.
I just needed to share this with the world. Had to spread the joy. http://t.co/B1aPvXXM
I just noticed I have a pile of tiny bananas sitting on an old reference card for a book by Freud. heh.
I just put a bunch of my clothes in the freezer. I am such a wimp when it comes to heat. Uuugh.

I just woke up from a three hour nap and, let me tell you, I could have gone longer. #RESIDENCYWATCH
I just...I just love Mabel, guys. #gravityfalls #bestshow #ever #seriously
I know it's her White line and everything, but I never in a million years thought I would own a Vera Wang. I'm giddy as f***.
I leave Daniel alone with my mystery serial for 5 minutes, and it devolves into hella nerdery http://twitpic.com/3tgb7y
I left the house more than once today!  Progress.
I like Colm Meaney quite a lot.
I love books. Bookie books books. Here they go up, up into my brain.
I love etymological dictionaries so, so much. http://t.co/O2EGT0sE
I love the NW, but it makes me feel strange. In both Portland and Seattle, I am always and never at home. #howliminal #letsgetexistential
I love the weekends, the prospect of the weekend, and who I get to see on the weekends. Weekend!
I love to dance in empty elevators (the more twirling, the better)
I love when people on the bus who look crazy discuss the intricacies of amino acids and proteins. I really do.
I love you, too thesleepypeach! Sorry it was a morning of misunderstandings. Can I unironically blame it on it being Monday? :P
I made a hat with Li'l Brudder! dfwaffles is modeling it. I think it suits him. http://t.co/1y5fSbTd
I made some business cards on Charlemagne! I'm meeting other writers tonight. And I'm suuuper nervous. http://t.co/1u5jae3
I may or may not be blasting the Little Mermaid soundtrack.
I met Mary Poppins and Bert today. I was really nervous about it (because Disneyland makes you a 5 year old with its magics).
I might explode.
I might throw up.
I miss my boo, internet.
I miss my cat, so I drew a picture of her as a farmer. She drives the most adorable tractor. http://t.co/6mI3GSM6
I must find this man they call "Reuben" and thank him for inventing such a fabulous sandwich. High fives may even be in order.
I pronounce today Good Reading Day, in which I read lots of Bukowski and D. Thomas and bask in the rush and comfort they provide me.
I seriously love reading. Literature is for lovers.
I should not be surprised that Matthew knows all the words to "Shape of My Heart"
I should probably take a break from reading only brilliant lit since it makes me feel profoundly inadequate, but I can't help myself.
I spend a lot of time and money supporting artists I love. It feels so good!
I spent most of my day tending the Czuba Family Farm. Chickens and guinea pigs are all clean and happy. I am covered in hay.
I spent some dollars at the craft fair! I love crafts. http://t.co/SDrGrpD
I strongly identify with WreckhallAbbey http://t.co/nA5X2Y86
I suggested having a seance so I could talk to Charles Dickens. Based on the face he made, Daniel is not in support of this idea.
I swear Ldartagnan I will be able to draw you one day. Here's another attempt, but dammit! Not quite right. •_• http://t.co/S44KhvAj
I think "faint heart never won fair lady" should be my motto/mantra for the crazy new life I appear to be leading.
I think I feel a bout of existential crisis coming on. Feels like confusion, and tingling in the extremities.
I think I'm having an Ecstatic Attack.
I think I'm in need of a St Jude/St Joan team up. Ooh, how ultimate would THAT be, Marvel? ha...
I think Yoda speaks the equivalent of directly translated latin. Suddenly enlightened I feel. (Admit it. It makes total sense.)
I think it is tea time.
I think that if you hate New Girl, you hate me.
I think was born a bit too late to fulfill my destiny as a cartographer.
I turn on Pandora and ''I Dreamed A Dream'' is the first song that starts playing. Pandora, you wicked, music-box saboteur, you. Gaaaah.
I used to be a pro at this, but this story has me stumped: how does one craft the perfect title? Inspiration, feel free to hit me.
I want Pete Fromm to think I'm cool #RESIDENCYWATCH

I want to go fishing. Does anybody want to go fishing with me?
I want to lead a beautiful life.
I want to look like all of these ladies. SO GORGEOUS. #androgynyFTW http://t.co/JmsspEti
I want twenty million tattoos.
I want: a drink with alcohol in it, a flat on lock-down, a friggin' word processor for this mac, the ability to walk between the worlds.
I was cool before it was cool to be cool. #cool #me #iamcool
I was going to have mutant nutria as forest-monsters in my novel--and then I remembered that Princess Bride beat me to it.
I was hoping to do a bunch of stuff today, but then I somehow slept until 2, and now my cat's angry b/c she's been lap-deprived. Oops.
I was jealous of all the halloween twitter icons, so I had to make one, too. And first otter drawn on the compy! (secret: I used MS Paint)
I was saved by my parents' neighbor who was out getting his cat. Matthew and Daniel, playing Mario in the basement, were deaf to my pleas.
I watched Hotel Chevalier tonight, and that was a big mistake. Hide the hair clippers.
I wear fewer dresses, but that is the only difference.
I wish I could go to more cons/expos. LOOK at Chris Ware's poster for SPX! I'm swooning. (&amp; distracted from work. oops) http://t.co/5IgL57x7
I wish I had an easily-accessible rooftop or pocket-mountain to stand upon and shout really nice things from.
I wish I liked drinking more. What drugs can I do, guys? lol but really my brain needs altering
I wish I was better with languages. "Killian Czuba: Novelist, Optimist, Amateur Philologist" would be effin' rad on business cards.
I wish I was smoochin' this hunk. Too bad he's 5000 miles away. THANK YOU, WORLD. #jk #nothankyou http://t.co/6B99HLvw
I wish the dog and cat were friends so I could snuggle with the cat. I miss her being all up on me every second.
I wish work was more like The Office and less like Office Space. Though, perhaps most discouraging is that I know the difference.
I would classify today's moving ordeal as "hellish"
I would like to "follow my dreams" of living with the person I love. No effing bootstraps, no amount of "heart",  to help me with that one.
I would like, sometime this week, to wake up and think: it's time to wake up! instead of: it's 3am. Awesome.
I'd like to be Leonardo da Vinci when I grow up. Only, a lady. And a novelist instead of the helicopter inventor. T'would be baller.
I'm a grumpy grump today. Kind of rocking the "disgruntled owl look" with all my ruffled feathers.
I'm a reorganizing/rearranging freak today.
I'm a sadness panda. I apologize in advance for 4-16 days of sadness tweets.
I'm a starving artist with writer's block and a huge utility bill. Which means more hours in The Cubicle. This totally whomps.

I'm dying my hair pink and blue today, because hair dye is cheaper than therapy.
I'm going to punch everyone--except this awesome family we're sitting with. They're rad. Everyone else is getting punched in the mouth.
I'm gonna go out in this thunderstorm and smoke a cigarette and maybe I'll get hit by lightening because that's my week, folks.

I'm gonna nap aaaaaall day.
I'm great with the bouyies.
I'm having a difficult time "applying myself" today. I am, instead, reading the wikipedia page on pookas and considering a morning nap.
I'm in need of a good writing space. Anyone have a big, comfy chair for hire that's pajama-ready and teapot-accessible?
I'm in this uniquely terrible mood. There is no meme for what I'm feeling--though Sad Keanu gets close.
I'm jonesin' for some Public Radio.

I've been inspired by thesleepypeach to do one of those photo-a-day-for-a-month things! So I'm gonna do it. #photoadayMay
I've been kind of a hulk lately. I'm kind of okay with that, though.
I've been sucking at photo-a-day the last few days. It's because every free minute I've had, I've been writing or sleeping. Speaking of slee
I've decided I need a shoulder-monkey promptly. If you feel like buying me a marmoset, hollah.

If they'd made a Psychomachia game vs Inferno: boobs, lady fights, decapitation, the 7 deadlies... all SANS lit bastardization!
If you ask me what comic book character I would be, I will not even hesitate: Hellboy or Nightcrawler. BAMF.
If you did give in to the feeling, you'd probably puke rose petals.
If you eat an entire bag of Doritos and accidentally leave the heat on in your room all night, you will probably vomit. #andnowyouknow

It is snailing so hard outside.
It may be sleep deprivation, but these new, fuchsia leopard-print tights and my old suspenders feel like a superb outfit for work tomorrow.

thefoxconfesses coincidentally, eating dragonfruit brought on this revelation! It's pretty freaky. Freaky delicious! haha
thefoxconfesses dfwaffles HAHAHA! Yeah, D would make a pretty cute turntable.
thefoxconfesses dfwaffles sext: u r a babe. i want to take u home &amp; make u fancy darjeeling. some fine Tippy Golden Orange Pekoe 1.
thefoxconfesses done and done! Sweet
thefoxconfesses haha! Yep! (it was more like leftover rice that we threw some nori on top of and ate like animals who never invented tools)
thefoxconfesses heehee that's mah baybee! Awww, my sweet stinky. :D
thefoxconfesses it did! Sleep helped, too. :P almost done w/ all the nonsense, but it's gonna be tight. Eep!
thefoxconfesses it was a magical time! we also drank wine, though bloody maries (marys? wtf pluralizing names) may have been more in-theme
thefoxconfesses or it means you just pwned a sea witch
thefoxconfesses our grocer pooped on my last bit of normalcy. (want to hang out this week? :))
thefoxconfesses perfecto :)
thefoxconfesses she's a cat of many talents. Did you know she's also a football player? Her position is feline backer.
thefoxconfesses so cute!
thefoxconfesses the. worst.
thefoxconfesses thesleepypeach I just horked up some lunch. *gerbleeeeegh*
thefoxconfesses thesleepypeach yes, you definitely need to revel in it. :D
thefoxconfesses tho obviously I don't think your feelings are unfounded. I'm just trying to help you fight the fear with compliments! ;D
thefoxconfesses ugh, my brain IS exploding with work, but I would welcome the break. :P you could always show me tomorrow if it isn't due
thefoxconfesses we make the most adorably dysfunctional team. :*
thefoxconfesses welcome back to broke academic life. :/ You can come over and drink free tea at my house this week! Free is nice.
thefoxconfesses why why why! :D
thefoxconfesses yay! awesome picture!!
thefoxconfesses yay! emotions!
thefoxconfesses you have to come down to Portland and visit and see Watson and sleep in the lil guest house! My mom said she'd love it. :))
thekimfiles I should try tweeting about ice cream and puppies so my friends think I'm happy sometimes. haha
there's a gremlin in our apartment. http://t.co/m8Gi0MLS
thesleepypeach (it's nice to have people to "do a good job for", like you &amp; D et al. It's easier when it's selfless, for some reason)
thesleepypeach ...(2) but I know I'm going to be glad when I've seen them all--such cultural importance! It's fun to feel clued-in :))
thesleepypeach Beautiful birthday girl! I love. :)
thesleepypeach I just heard it somewhere, too! Weird. ...It's too early for the '00s to come back, right?
thesleepypeach I know, I need to try it! I'm just lazy, and also afraid of change. haha
thesleepypeach I maaaay have made it up. haha. :P but I would totally take a real one in a hot second!
thesleepypeach I think the solution is to hire a staff comic writer. Have people submit a portfolio and get hired for reasonable pay.
thesleepypeach I was surprised I liked Alien so much for that very reason! We have the other two for future viewing too--woo!
thesleepypeach I'll make you proud! ;D
thesleepypeach I'm still pooping my pants about it. Apparently, I LOVE TO BE BUSY. haha. But, srsly, I'm so stoked. :D
thesleepypeach I've seen it happen a couple of times. Your new one is super cute! also delicious.
thesleepypeach It would work well if we ended up in SF, too! Bonus!
thesleepypeach It's the same w/ writing, tho. It's not a hobby--it's my life &amp; livelihood. The issue is ppl thinking it's not a real job.
thesleepypeach PS does homemade sushi + seaweed salad sound good for dinner tomorrow?
thesleepypeach SO GOOD! Aw man, I also love the cat head with legs.
thesleepypeach She is totally stoked. :D
thesleepypeach TheIcyPeak NEED.
thesleepypeach Truth.
thesleepypeach also, it was never really a hobby--I went to school for it, and am still going to school for it
thesleepypeach and!: I'm so glad you liked it! :D I haven't drawn basically anything since I started school. blegh. I needed it. :)
thesleepypeach but if I had gone to school to be an engineer, teacher, mechanic because I love it, would that be any different?
thesleepypeach definitely. I thought 2 would be fun bc of the action--and it mostly was, but I was taken aback by how gorey it was (1)
thesleepypeach dfwaffles our names were made for jazz
thesleepypeach dfwaffles whatever. Daniel is my wife!
thesleepypeach hahahaha!
thesleepypeach is that a beautiful pink grapefruit floating in that nummy beverage? my turn to drool. droooooool.
thesleepypeach more and more, i find that's true. always looking for the place where I fit in.
thesleepypeach oh my god, this is the last time I ask daniel how to spell anything. Also: proof that I know nothing about marriage. Bah. :P
thesleepypeach oh no, what??!
thesleepypeach oh, yeah, duh. haha
thesleepypeach one day, he will get his Bean Bunny
thesleepypeach ooh, yeah, that's a good one! Maybe parasails, too, but I bet Flan wouldn't like that much.
thesleepypeach same for Shmoop :/
thesleepypeach sort of? Move to Portland is almost done, but then we move again/for reals in a month. Blah, moving. When do you go south?
thesleepypeach still not *totally* sure, but we're out of our apartment July 31. :S We'll stay in PDX until we move (mid-Augustish?)
thesleepypeach thefoxconfesses Man, I should borrow some of y'alls stoked-juice. I'm just getting anxious again. :P
thesleepypeach thefoxconfesses Me. Too. I miss yous twos. And our wine nights were legit.
thesleepypeach they've changed it since this morning. comics writers were blowing them up. originally, it said 2-per-month for a year.
thesleepypeach this exact thing popped up on my Netflix and I was like "uhhh, even I know that's not right."
thesleepypeach this makes me miss my books so much. Your new place looks amazing! Stoked for more pics!
thesleepypeach worthy of so much wine! It looks awesome.
thesleepypeach yes! Now that Move, Phase 1 is done, fingers crossed for a little smooth sailing with the next month of prep. :P
thesleepypeach you were just making sure they were paying attention. :P on that note: are you ok??
this comic is wonderful. I won't do it justice w/ 140-c summary, so just read and pass it on. (may be NSFW) http://t.co/yMmyL4vW

twelve year olds are terrible oh god the house is full of them *cries*
twitter, I have an important question: have I...made bad choices?
ugh hand me a book. I want to avoid real life and also the internet. ok going now to read FOR EVER
ungggghhhhhhhh. why is everything difficult. i'm going to quit my non-existent day job and start singing sultry, existential jams.
update: eating Stovetop stuffing and reading every Achewood strip ever written ever.
wait, now i have to pack? #wat
we're on this sporadic 9am-midnight work schedule. I kind of like it, but maybe I'm insane and a hermit?

when you make a cup of tea and it gets cold so you put it in the microwave and then forget about it for six hours
when you're snuggled up in bed with fresh sheets after a toasty shower and then the cat poops and stinks up the joint
when you're so tired that you take a sip of tea and realize you're trying to drink out of your phone
why am I not drinking right now? I've heard drinking to avoid one's problems is a good life decision. #personalstatements #hell
why is a tiny, floating batman head SO FUNNY? also, why am I still awake. #MYSTERY http://t.co/ypKD17NF

yesterday, the words "I'll mapquest it" accidentally left my mouth, and I was forced to teleport back to 2001.
you know what word is totally hilarious? milquetoast. milquetoast is hilarious.
