What I've done here:

Get most of Killian's tweets with scrape_twitter.py
(not sure how "paging" works. Asking for 1000 tweets seems to get "about 170". Asking for page 2 seems to start at about 200. So I tried to ask for 1000 tweets 10 times, and I got about 1560, which had some duplicates.)
Pipe them through sort and uniq to get down to about 1363 unique tweets.

Create a markov model of her tweets.
Output a few good ones.
Post to twitter.
